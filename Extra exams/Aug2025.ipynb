    "The mean absolute relative error (MARE) measures the average relative deviation between the predicted and true salaries. A lower MARE indicates better predictive performance. In salary prediction problems, a relatively high MARE is common due to large variance in salaries and unobserved factors such as company size, location, and specific role responsibilities. If the MARE is significantly above, for example, 20–30%, this suggests that a linear model may be too simplistic for this task.\n",

    "\n",
    "The scatter plot shows how close the predicted salaries are to the true salaries. Ideally, the points should lie close to the diagonal line. A wide spread around the diagonal indicates large prediction errors, especially for high-paying jobs. Systematic deviations (e.g. underestimating high salaries) suggest model bias and limitations of linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the linear regression model captures some global trends in the data but struggles to accurately predict individual salaries. This is expected due to the complexity of salary determination and the categorical nature of some variables. More advanced models (e.g. regularized regression, tree-based models, or proper encoding of categorical variables) would likely improve performance."
