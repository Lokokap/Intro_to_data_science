    "I assumed that the individual sample costs are independent and bounded between 0 and the maximum cost (here 600 for a false negative). Using Hoeffding’s inequality, I constructed a 95% confidence interval around the empirical mean cost on the test set. This gives a conservative, distribution-free bound on the true expected cost per transaction. The interval represents where we expect the true average cost to lie with 95% confidence, assuming the test samples are independent realizations from the same distribution."
